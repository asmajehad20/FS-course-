<p>I'm Asma Jehad.</p>
<p>24 years old, a recent Computer Engineering graduate.
  I enrolled in this course to have fun and find a sense of purpose.
  I'm hoping to gain new perspectives and, simply put, to pass some time doing something that might help me move forward from the state of stillness I'm in.</p>
